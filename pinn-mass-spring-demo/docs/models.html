  <h1>The Two Neural Network Approaches</h1>
  <h2>1. Baseline Neural Network</h2>
  <p>The baseline model is a small fully connected neural network. It receives the time <em>t</em> as input and predicts the displacement <em>x(t)</em>. During training we show it our noisy measurements and ask it to minimize the average squared difference between its predictions and those noisy values.</p>
  <p>This approach is flexible, but with little data the model does not know anything about the underlying physics. It might overfit the noisy points and make strange predictions outside the training window.</p>

  <h2>2. Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN)</h2>
  <p>The PINN uses the exact same architecture. The difference is in the loss function used during training. Alongside the data loss described above, we also measure how well the network satisfies the mass–spring differential equation.</p>
  <p>To compute the physics loss we use automatic differentiation to find the velocity and acceleration of the network output. We plug those into the equation <code>m * x''(t) + c * x'(t) + k * x(t)</code>. If the result is not close to zero, the model is breaking the rules of physics, and we penalize it.</p>
  <p>Because the PINN is nudged toward physically valid solutions, it tends to produce smoother, more realistic curves even when data are noisy or sparse.</p>

  Same network, different training signals: that is the key difference between a pure NN and a PINN.
