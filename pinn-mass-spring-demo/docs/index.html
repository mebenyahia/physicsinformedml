  <h1>PINN Demo – Mass Spring System</h1>
  <p>This small site accompanies the repository and provides a guided tour of the physics, data, and neural networks used in the demo. Everything is written for curious beginners: we explain new ideas slowly, link back to the notebooks, and highlight the most important observations.</p>
  <p>A Physics Informed Neural Network (PINN) is a neural network that learns from measurements <em>and</em> from the differential equation describing the system. By respecting the physics, the model stays stable even when we have little or noisy data.</p>
  <p>Use the navigation bar to explore the equation that governs the mass and spring, how we generate synthetic data, what models we train, and how the results compare.</p>

  <h2>Getting started</h2>
  <p>Want to run the code yourself? Visit the project <a href="../README.md">README</a> for setup instructions. Once your environment is ready, open the notebooks in the <code>notebooks/</code> folder to follow the experiments step by step.</p>
